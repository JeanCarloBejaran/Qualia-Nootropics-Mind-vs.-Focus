# Qualia-Nootropics-Mind-vs.-Focus
Nootropic ingredients comparison of Qualia Mind vs. Qualia Focus: 
Two nootropic stacks created by neurohacker.
Website: https://neurohacker.com/

I web-scraped the data from Neurohacker's website using the requests and Pandas Libraries.
Cleaned, wrangled and merged the Qualia Mind and Focus datasets into a final dataframe to view the differences in ingredients and effects resulting from a potential transition. 

# Problem 
  What are the effects of switching to Qualia Focus?

### Framing the problem as a mathematical question:
  How similar are Qualia Mind and Qualia Focus? 
  What are the differences down to the ingredient level?

# Conclusion
  Qualia Focus and Qualia Mind are very similar. From 28 total ingredients, 4 were completely removed and 5 were changed in total quantities.
  
  So far, based on the data, Qualia Mind does in fact appear to promote overall brain health for short and long term mental well-being. With the ingredient changes in Focus, the trade-off appears to be on removing the dimension of long term wholistic mental health and focus on a "thinking fast on your feet" approach: increasing attention and working memory.

If transitioning, you can expect a decline in long term health factors such as neuroprotective effects, aging memory decline prevention, executive function and stress reduction. 

*Notes: 
Project development discontinued because the data we used is no longer accessible from the maker's website and we have answered our original question.
